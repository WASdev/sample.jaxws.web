Web Services Sample
==============

The WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile `jaxws-2.2` feature, included in the extended content for the Liberty Profile, supports the Java API for XML-Based Web Services. With this feature, it is easy to develop web services applications on the Liberty profile.

This sample contains a server definition that includes the `jaxws-2.2` feature. It also contains a demo application which demonstrates a number of JAX-WS features supported by the Liberty profile.

This sample can be installed onto runtime versions 8.5.5.0 and later.
Instructions

The ServletJDBCEngine sample contains a server definition for basic servlet support, and illustrates a simple datasource definition using an included configuration file. It uses Apache Derby (an open source relational database). Also included is a servlet which gets a connection to the database using the defined datasource, creates a table, inserts some data, retrieves the data, and prints the data out to the browser.

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9131/jaxws](http://localhost:9131/jaxws).

## Running in Eclipse with Maven

1. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Maven Project'.
2. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Maven Clean**.
3. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Maven Install**.
4. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Run on Server**.
5. You should see the following message in the console: `Application JAXWSWebSample started in XX.XX seconds.`

## Running with Maven

This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install Liberty with Java EE7 Full Platform runtime from the Maven Central. Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

In your browser, enter the URL for the application: [http://localhost:9131/jaxws](http://localhost:9131/jaxws/) (where port 9131 assumes the httpEndpoint provided in the sample server.xml has not been modified).
There are 7 scenarios for different JAX-WS features in the left. You can navigate each scenario to experience these features.
